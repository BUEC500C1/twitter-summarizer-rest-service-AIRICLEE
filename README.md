# Twitter-summarizer-rest-service
  
## User Guide
  1. Run the restWeb.py in AWS EC2
  2. Enter the URL: ec2-3-15-11-151.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5000
  3. Then you can get web page, and enter what you want to search
  4. Get the Zip file of videos
  5. unzip it and you can get the videos of Twitter summarizer
  
## Note
In my design, the web page only can enter the keyword or twiiter account. But if you want to change the threads's name and number and task name, you need go to multiThreadTask.py to modify the paramter.

In this case, I set the default number of thread is 2, and names of task are "Jackson", "Lee", "Vincent"
